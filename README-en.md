##  Overview

Here's a compelling overview of the FakeNewsDetector project:

**Introducing FakeNewsDetector: Empowering Truth-Seekers

In today's digital age, it's crucial to stay informed about current events while avoiding misinformation. That's where FakeNewsDetector comes in – a cutting-edge tool designed to detect and debunk fake news. This innovative project uses AI-powered natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze news articles and identify potential fake news.

**Key Features:
Accurate article analysis using KeyBERT model
Real-time comparison with Naver's Open API for related news items
Cosine similarity score calculation for each article

				<td>- Here is a succinct summary that highlights the main purpose and use of the `accuracy_checker.py` file:

**Summarize**: The script evaluates the accuracy of news articles by comparing their descriptions with keywords extracted from the text<br>- It uses the KeyBERT model to identify relevant phrases, then retrieves related news items from Naver's Open API<br>- The script calculates a cosine similarity score for each article and assigns an accuracy rating based on this score.

**Key Points**: The script processes multiple files, extracts keywords, retrieves descriptions, and calculates scores for each file<br>- It also keeps track of total titles and average cosine similarity for each file.</td>

				<td>- Here is a succinct summary of the main purpose and use of the `crawling.py` file:

The script crawls the FactCheck SNU website to extract titles from fact-check cards, storing them in text files<br>- It can be run in either single-threaded or multi-threaded modes, with the latter utilizing multiple threads to process pages concurrently<br>- The script also checks the server's status before running and provides a choice for users to select their preferred mode of execution.</td>
